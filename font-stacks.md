## Font Stacks

Different Web safe fonts, font stack combinations and fallbacks, and typography classifications and definitions.

Here you will find recommendations for:

1.  Font stacks that you can copy and use in your project.

2.  Web safe fonts, i.e. fonts that are most common on most versions of Windows, Mac, and Linux.

    You can copy these and feel confident using them as your overall default font stack, or as a fallback font stack for a more interesting typeface.

3.  Typefaces that go well together, say one font for your headers and another contrasting font for your body.

4.  Mobile fonts.

5.  Font classifications and definitions.
