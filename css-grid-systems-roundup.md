## CSS Grid Systems Roundup

One thing to note about CSS frameworks is that pretty much all of them include a grid system to layout your page with, and if you don't want to use a CSS framework there are also a number of standalone grid systems that might be useful to you for this purpose. If you're not 100% sure what a grid system is, take a look at:

So why use a grid system? The following quote most succinctly answers this question:

> After a few minutes of griddy thinking, the benefits become clear: designers gain a rational, structured framework for organizing content and users gain well-organized, legible sites.

### Grid Systems

11. [Gridiculous][]

[Gridiculous]: http://gridiculo.us/

    > Gridiculous was created after I tried out a bunch of different responsive grids and realized that none of them offered all of the features I required. First and foremost, I wanted to make sure that the grid would work from a large desktop monitor through to a tablet and all the way down to a mobile phone. That's why Gridiculous starts off at 1200px and works itself down to 320px.
