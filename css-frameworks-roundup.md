## CSS Frameworks Roundup

CSS frameworks and grid systems can be extremely helpful when starting a new project.

- They give you a whole boatload of base styles that are instantly accessible through HTML tags and/or IDs and class names.
- They include well-thought-out typographic elements, default formats for almost every kind of HTML tag, and by simply following the frameworks parameters – or dropping in special framework class names – you can add some great looking styles to your project; that are built to work, with very few hitches, and across all browsers.
- On top of that most CSS frameworks come with prebuilt scripts for commonly used functions like pop-ups, modals, and menu systems.

### Frameworks

Here is a brief framework roundup worth taking a look at if you're interested in using a framework:

#### Twitter Bootstrap

I like [Twitter Bootstrap][]. It's a great place to learn about best practices for any application or framework, and you can get some amazing designs in absolutely no time, and it's well-documented.

But here's the problem: it's built on [Less][], and use it and your site will look pretty much like everyone else's. Of course you can override styles, but I'm just sayin'.

> Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

Getting it to work with Rails is not impossible, hardly, but if you go this path there are some choices to consider:

#### Blueprint

[Blueprint][], in my opinion, is the granddaddy of all frameworks. I used to use Blueprint all of the time, and Compass makes it readily available. It's tried-and-true, and a good choice, but I rarely use it these days. I'm not too crazy about it's look and feel. It does seem to be more of a minimalist framework - which is not a bad thing.

> Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

#### YUI

 I've used [YUI][] and personally I'm not too crazy about its grid system which is a pretty major component to any framework – so I generally stay away.

> YUI is a free, open source JavaScript and CSS library for building richly interactive web applications.

#### Foundation 3

I haven't used [Foundation][Zurb website], but I'm interested.

#### Skeleton

I also haven't used [Skeleton][], but soon enough.

#### Responsive Frameworks
